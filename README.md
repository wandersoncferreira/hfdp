# Heads First Design Patterns

I am reading and implementing in Clojure all the examples of the book. You will probably need the
book in order to follow the examples here, because there are lots of text around each problem to
explain the design pattern friendlier.

The idea is to get an implementation that satisfies the following requirements:

	- The same behavior as the Java version
	- As much Clojure idiomatic as possible
	- Fewer mutable state as possible
	

If you can come up with a better implementation I will be very happy to merge to this project.
