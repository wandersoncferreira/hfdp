# Head First Design Patterns

I am reading and implementing in Clojure all the examples of the book. You will probably need the
book in order to follow the examples here, because there are lots of text around each problem to
explain the design pattern friendlier.

The idea is to get an implementation that satisfies the following requirements:

	- The same behavior as the Java version
	- As much Clojure idiomatic as possible but still using the notion of 'objects'
	- Fewer mutable state as possible
	

If you can come up with a better implementation I will be very happy to merge to this project.

If I would implement the same "behavior" using only functions or let's say a more data-driven
strategy, the solutions would be different. Maybe I am trying to think like a Java programmer with
the available clojure tools. Or to be fair, I want to do a similar implementation as offered in the
book.
